## Roguemon Extension for Ironmon Tracker

This is an extension for the [Gen 3 Ironmon Tracker](https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker), intended to add support for the [Roguemon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uU1KeFB_kjIULXArfwdLjZrNV_D_IXi0h2wD_nP6erQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) ruleset by Crozwords.

This extension only works with Pokemon FireRed, and is intended for use with the [National Dex patch](https://github.com/CyanSMP64/NatDexExtension/releases/tag/v1.1.3) although most of the features still work without it.

## Features
- Automatic tracking and display of HP and status caps.
- Automatic prize rolls when a milestone is met. The player will be prompted to choose one of 3 prizes; if the prize provides an item, that item will automatically be deposited in the bag.
- Prizes that provide permanent abilities, or abilities that can be saved, are tracked and displayed on-screen, however some of their effects will need to be carried out manually by the player.
- At any time, the player may press the ! button on the main screen to view the list of stored prizes, and remove them when they have been used.
- All item-based evolutions are changed to use a Moon Stone, which is renamed to a RogueStone. Players will be a offered a RogueStone at set points throughout the run.
- Segments are automatically tracked, and the main screen will display total and mandatory trainers in the current segment, as well as the next segment when the player is between segments.
- Curses are automatically determined at the beginning of the run and applied, giving unique negative effects in certain sections of the game.
- A special randomizer version, as well as settings strings for the randomizer, are included in the download.
